FILES

goldilox.php      -- Contains the actual reference code for the reference solution.

.htaccess         -- Contains a helper file for apache to pass valid URLS to the program.

genfiles_task.py  -- This consistently generates all the static files needed for the test into
                     a sub-directory called 'static'. This will always generate the same data
                     for each person.

GETTING STARTED (APACHE)
1. Deploy the php file somewhere in a document root you are happy to serve from.
2. Run the python script to generate the static files in the document root.
3. In the document root create a directory called 'dynamic' and make sure that
   the user that runs PHP has write access to it.
4. Setup the apache vhost such that it responds over SSL and over IPv6.
